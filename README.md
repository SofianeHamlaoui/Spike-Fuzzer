# Spike-Fuzzer
I looked for Spike-Fuzzer ( Spike on Archlinux ) everywhere on github and didn't find it ! So I did it by myself :D 
+ ( Audits )
## Note :

BTW : to use spike commands ! don't forget to add 'spike-fuzzer-' before that 

`Ex: "generic-send_tcp" ` becomes  `"spike-fuzzer-generic-send_tcp" `

## Installation :
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SofianeHamlaoui/Spike-Fuzzer.git && cd Spike-Fuzzer
sudo pacman -U Spike-Fuzzer.tar.xz 
```
you can build the package by your self ( if you want )
